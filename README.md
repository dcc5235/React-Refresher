# React Refresher Notes

Developed by Facebook to upgrade codebases/architecture (there was a need for it as websites became more complex and bugs became more prevalent in code). React was released to the developer community in 2013.

#### DOM Manipulation

DOM (Document Object Model) is used to display websites through JavaScript using imperative style. Imperative style directly performs an action each and every part of an app in response to various user events. The developer must explicitly state each step of how something should be done. This makes it difficult to see relationships between events as the page flow/layout becomes more complex. In React, declarative style is used, instaed. Declarative style holds the state (data) which allows React to find the best way to manipulate the DOM to load that information. The different states are accounted for in one place which means cleaner and more efficient code quality, as well as faster load time.
